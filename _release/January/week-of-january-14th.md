When opening the engagement window in embedded mode on a mobile browser, the window will be 5% transparent. This ensures that the engagement window was opened on top of the website, and that the consumer was not redirected to another page.

In some cases, where the design of the underlying website conflicts with the design of the engagement window, the consumer might think that there is something wrong with the engagement window. In this case, the brand can decide to keep the engagement window in embedded mode and it will be solid, not showing the underlying website.

**How to change the opacity**

1. On the Campaign page, click on the “Edit” function next to the “Engagement window” of the relevant engagement.![](/img/week-of-january-14th-3b.png)

   {: .important}

   This setting is on the window level, and will apply to all the engagements
2. Click on the relevant window and select “edit.”
3. In the Engagement window studio, open “Additional window settings” in the top right corner.
4. Define the window opacity on mobile web.
5. Click “**Save**”

**Notes:**

* This applies only to the embedded mode, and only for Mobile Web messaging.
* The default is “No”, which is the current behavior.

### Bot connectors: Support for Google Dialogflow V2 in the LivePerson Bot Platform OOTB Connectors

Support has been added for Google Dialogflow V2 in the LivePerson Bot Platform OOTB Connectors. Google [Dialogflow V2](https://dialogflow.com/docs) integrations require oAuth2 authentication. The connector platform now allows for access to Dialogflow V2 intent APIs VIA oAuth2 credentials. Previously the Bot Platform Connectors supported Dialogflow V2.Customers can self service their Dialogflow V2 bots & configure the required oAuth2 credentials VIA the LivePersons OOTB configuration & management tools rather than build or upgrade their existing connector.

Brands should seek consult with their LivePerson field teams before making a decision.

### Bot Connectors: Support for Google Dialogflow V2 in the LivePerson Bot Platform OOTB Connector Console & Connector service

Support has been added for [Google Dialogflow V2](https://dialogflow.com/docs) in the LivePerson Bot Platform OOTB Connector Console & Connector service. Integration guides can be found in the LivePerson [developer hub](https://developers.liveperson.com/customer-facing-bots-deploying-bots-to-liveengage.html).

## Enhancements

### Bot connectors: Deprecation of Google Dialogflow V1

As of October 23rd 2019 Google Dialogflow V1 will be deprecated. Customers should migrate before this date to V2, see [migration guide](https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/v1-v2-migration-guide)

## Bug fixes

If the ACD setting for chat was configured to “advanced mode” and “agent status changes to **away** if missed accepting the chat,” and then afterwards, the setting was changed to “Auto-accept” mode, the agent state would still change to “away” in some scenarios.
