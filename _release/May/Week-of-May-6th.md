Function as a Service (FaaS) is a LivePerson feature which enables brands to develop custom behaviors within the LiveEngage platform, to better tailor the system to their specific needs. By offering these capabilities, FaaS enables developers to write a simple function, deploy it to LivePerson's infrastructure and make it available to their LivePerson account in minutes. This allows you to create custom logic inside our conversational platform

FaaS is ready to be accessed via [https://faas.liveperson.net](https://faas.liveperson.net "https://faas.liveperson.com") for all customers.

**How to enable**

Our FaaS UI allows developers to directly develop, deploy and test new functions.

You can either access this UI via [https://faas.liveperson.net](https://faas.liveperson.net "https://faas.liveperson.net") or by using the LivePerson Domain API to retrieve the corresponding domain of service for faasUI

To get access to this page, you'll need to ask your LivePerson account team to enable the correct permissions for your account. Please contact them to do so. Please see the [Developers Community](https://developers.liveperson.com/function-as-a-service-getting-started.html) for more information.

AC Feature FaaS.FaaS needs to be enabled for the account.

The FaaS Secrets Storage allows you to centrally store, access and distribute secrets across your lambdas. Thereby, lambdas can use available access tokens, certificates and encryption keys to establish a connection to external systems.

**How to enable**
Secrets can be maintained via the **Settings** tab as a key/value storage. Each value can be of type number, string or JSON. For more information, please see the [Developers Community](https://developers.liveperson.com/function-as-a-service-developing-with-faas-storing-secrets.html).

LivePerson now supports Appleâ€™s augmented reality (AR) file which allows agents to send augmented reality (AR) file types to consumers via a link. This ability allows agents to deliver immersive, engaging experiences that seamlessly blend virtual objects with the real world. Currently, agents can send AR files up to 10MB.

### \[Apple Business Chat\] Enhanced Secure Forms via rich link (CX-327)

Currently, once a secure form is sent by the agent to the consumer, the consumer has to click twice in order to open the form. In order to improve the consumer experience, secure forms will be shown as rich links. The link will include the secure form name and will require only one tap to be opened.

Once deployed, secure forms via rich links will become the default behavior for secure forms in ABC. No configuration is required. No changes are needed from the agent side.

### Connectors vanity URL support for Secure Forms (CX-183)

<div class="tablecontainer">
<table class="releasenotes">

<tr class="categoryrow">

<th>Twilio</th>

</div>

Currently, the secure form link includes a domain owned by LivePerson. Consumers might not trust a domain that is different than the brand they are communicating with and therefore might avoid using it. Using a vanity URL solution, the secure forms links will be sent with the brand domain/certificate instead of a LivePerson domain.

In order to enable vanity URL for secure forms for connectors, brands need to follow the standard LiveEngage process of vanity URL enablement, in this case for LE CDN (leCdnDomain). For brands that already have vanity URL enabled for their website, this will take effect automatically on the secure form, no additional configuration is needed.

**To enable/disable vanity URL please speak to your LivePerson account team.**

## Enhancements

### Queue prioritization by day of the week

Support defining a different prioritization strategy based not only the time of the day (available) but also which day is it. For example, on Monday, between 8 AM and 10:59 AM prioritize the queue based on queue entrance time only 20% of the time. However, during the rest of the week prioritize based queue entrance time 50% of the time.

This enhancement is available to customers that have previously configured queue prioritization by an LPA.
