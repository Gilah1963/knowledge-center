New “Horizon” theme is added to the Engagement Window Library. The Horizon theme will become the default engagement window, replacing the Ocean theme:

* New LiveEngage accounts will have Horizon theme as their default window.
* For existing accounts there will be no impact on existing engagements and windows. The new default will take place only once the campaign manager / admin creates a new window or a new engagement.
* Existing accounts can proactively change their existing engagements to work with the new Horizon theme, if they wish to.
* The Ocean theme will still be available in the Engagement Window Library for both new and existing accounts, in case they prefer to use it as is or as their starting point for creating new windows.

Horizon theme comprises of the following features (that are different from the Ocean theme):

* Large window
* New image at the header
* Chevron minimize icon
* Top bar icon is set to "round bubble outline"
* Top window corners radius is bigger
* Agent and consumer bubble style is set to "three corner rounded"
* Consumer bubble with visual read indication (relevant only for messaging)
* Consumer bubble border is blue
* Text area is light gray
* Window is closed automatically once consumer ends conversation, or upon submitting the post chat / conversation survey, if applicable.

The Horizon theme will be the default for both chat and web messaging engagements and will impact desktop and mobile experiences. In order to modify this theme, brands can use the “Add new” option on the Engagement Window Library. Brands can still use the Ocean theme as their starting point by using the Duplicate option from the action menu.

The 2 new templates are:

* A new “Message us” bubble with rounded corners and editable text - this will be the new default, replacing the “Live Chat” invitation.

Users can configure Disambiguation dialog in the Conversation builder which will automatically present intent clarification question and resolve intent to keep conversation on track.

In conversation flow, a consumer sends a messages and a bot understands user intent and prepares response. Sometimes, when a bot is trying to determine consumer intent, the text matches with more than one intent with similar confidence levels. In this situation, Automatic Disambiguation of intents allows bots to offer a clarification question to the consumer to clarify which intent is the best match, steering the conversation flow down the right path.
