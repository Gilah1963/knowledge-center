Queue prioritization allows you to efficiently allocate staffing resources and better handle incoming messages by prioritizing conversations in queues based on queue entrance time or time when the consumer responded.

The goal of this feature is to improve agent efficiency and consumer satisfaction KPIâ€™s by driving more conversations towards a resolution.

* The new prioritization algorithm allows brands to choose a custom blend of prioritization approaches for driving more actionable conversations towards a resolution. The approaches are:
  * **Queue entrance time** - Give priority to conversations according to their entrance time into the queue.
  * **Conversation interactiveness** - Give priority to conversations where the consumer has just written a message and therefore is considered more interactive.
* Brands can now define their own business rules that dictate which conversations to prioritize based on the number of transfers the conversation has been through or by assigning a higher priority to conversations that are being transferred to or from a specific skill.

<br />
**The following parameters are taken into consideration in the new queue prioritization:**

* Manual ettr
* Off Hours

The new sorting algorithm no longer sorts by ettr. Manual ettr and off hours which were part of ettr calculator will not affect the queue prioritization sorting algorithm.

**Enablement:** Please contact your LivePerson account team to enable this feature.
