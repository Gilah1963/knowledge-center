## Bugs Fixes

### Welcome message is sent in Post Conversation Survey (CX-320)

<div class="tablecontainer">
<table class="releasenotes"> <thead> <tr class="categoryrow"> <th>Web Messaging</th> <th>Mobile App Messaging</th> <th>SMS</th> <th>Facebook Messenger</th> <th>ABC</th> <th>Line</th> <th>Google RCS</th> <th>Google My Business</th> <th>WhatsApp Business</th> <th>CM</th> <th>Chat</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Yes</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>
</div>

When the welcome message is configured for “Every new conversation” and a Post Conversation Survey is configured for the window, the welcome message is displayed after the conversation is closed and before the survey is displayed.

This issue has now been resolved and when the conversation is closed, the welcome message will not be shown when the PCS is configured, even when the welcome message is configured for “Every new conversation”.

### Agent avatar appears next to visitor’s message when visitor sent an image (CX-169)

<div class="tablecontainer">
<table class="releasenotes"> <thead> <tr class="categoryrow"> <th>Web Messaging</th> <th>Mobile App Messaging</th> <th>SMS</th> <th>Facebook Messenger</th> <th>ABC</th> <th>Line</th> <th>Google RCS</th> <th>Google My Business</th> <th>WhatsApp Business</th> <th>CM</th> <th>Chat</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Yes</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>
</div>

When a brand is using web messaging and has the agent avatar enabled, the agent avatar appears next to the visitor’s message when the visitor sends an image to the agent.

This issue has now been resolved. The agent avatar should not appear next to the image when a visitor sends an image.
