The new Apple Business Chat Authentication Interactive Message enables businesses to authenticate consumers using OAuth2 protocol via the Business Chat conversation.

**Main capabilities:**

* Business Chat will support a new OOTB Interactive Message that allows brands to authenticate their consumers using their OAuth 2.0 provider (only from iOS 12 onwards)
* The brands will use their private OAuth service and will supply the service details in their Apple management area (register.apple.com). The details include:
  * Authentication endpoint URL
  * Token URL
  * Client Identifier
* LiveEngage will support agent/bot generation of the new Auth Interactive Message using the Structured Content framework and configuration (similar to list and time picker)
  * Agent/bot will know if consumer supports the new Auth Message via an engagement attribute, in order to determine if the consumer is qualified to receive the authentication message before sending it.
* Consumer will receive the Authentication Interactive Message and will be able to tap to authenticate on the brand’s Authentication service URL
* Agents and bots on LiveEngage will get real-time updates upon a consumer’s response
* Upon successful or failed authentication, LiveEngage will support passing the authentication status and token back to LiveEngage Conversational Metadata, in order to allow the brand to perform validation on the authentication information

{: .important}

This feature requires enablement - please contact your LivePerson account team

**Limitations**

* Currently the Authentication Interactive Message will only enable brands to perform authentication validation against their OAuth service, and will not enable them to automatically push authenticated engagement attributes to the conversation - supporting engagement attributes is planned for H1, 2018.
* In the current solution, only a bot (using the Agent SDK) can receive the authentication response from the consumer (after the consumer submits authentication on Business Chat) - In the next phase, we will add a user interface indication on LiveEngage which will allow a live agent to see authentication status as well.

Apple Pay provides an easy and secure way for consumers to buy goods and services within a Business Chat conversation - when a brand asks for payment from a customer who is purchasing goods and services through Business Chat, the consumer can use Apple Pay to make the payment.

**Main capabilities:**

* Business Chat will support a new OOTB Interactive Message that allows brands to submit payment requests to consumers using Apple Pay
* Brands will use their private Apple Pay accounts (or will create new accounts) and will supply their Apple Pay Merchant ID on their Apple management area (register.apple.com).

{: .notice}
Brands need to first register a Merchant Identifier (Merchant ID) in their Apple Developer Account to enable Apple Pay payments in Messages. For information on creating your merchant ID, see [Configuring Your Environment.](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/ApplePay_Guide/Configuration.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014764-CH2)

* LiveEngage will support agent/bot generation of the Apple Pay Interactive Message using the Structured Content framework and configuration (similar to list and time picker)
* Consumers will receive the Apple Pay Interactive Message and will be able to tap to pay using their Apple Pay user on their iOS device.
* Agents and bots on LiveEngage will get real-time updates upon a consumer payment response
* Upon successful or failed payment, LiveEngage will support passing the payment details back to LiveEngage Conversational Metadata in order to allow the brand to perform validation on the payment information against their Apple Pay account

#### Limitations

Mapping RCS Business Messaging information and passing it to LiveEngage Engagement Attributes:

**Consumer ID** - LiveEngage will manage a unique consumer RCS Business Messaging ID across the consumer’s conversations, for unified history, agent or bot context and to allow the brands to map the consumer ID info to CRM systems in order to manage user identity. The RCS Business Messaging consumer ID will be mapped to the Consumer ID field in the consumer profile information, as well as to the “Customer Info” - “Customer ID” engagement attribute, and will be visible in real time to the agent, to the agent widget SDK or to the agent SDK, as well as in historic conversations.

**RCS Agent ID** - The identifier for each business as registered in Google, which will be the brand registered RCS Agent ID. The Agent ID can be applied for skill routing logic.  
The brand’s RCS Agent ID will be mapped to the “Customer Info” - "companyBranch" engagement attribute, and will be visible in real time to the agent, to the agent widget SDK or to the agent SDK, as well as in historic conversations.

**Consumer Phone Number** - LiveEngage will collect the consumer’s phone number and pass it as an engagement attribute to the agent workspace and reporting. The consumer’s phone number will be mapped to the "Personal Info" - "Phone number" engagement attribute, and will be visible in real time to the agent, to the agent widget SDK or to the agent SDK, as well as in historic conversations.

{: .important}
This feature requires enablement** - please contact your LivePerson account team

The current version of the Twilio Connector has been migrated to the new LiveEngage connectors platform, which supports error handling, a message-retry mechanism and was built to enhance the Twilio connector’s performance.

## Bug fixes

### \[Twilio\] Failure to send a message to Twilio - isn't reported back to UMS and LE UI (LE-90596, LE-88928, LE-75265)

If an agent’s message fails to send to Twilio, there's no feedback sent to UMS and LE UI. This causes a error in agent experience, while there’s no error notification sent to the agent to notify him that the message wasn’t delivered.

The current version of theTwilio connector has now been migrated to the new LE connectors platform, which supports error handling and message-retry mechanisms for the connectors channels (in this case Twilio). The new version of the Twilio connector will retry sending the message to Twilio upon receiving a message failure, and will also report an error back to UMS and LE UI (“No Acknowledge” error), notifying the agent that the message was not sent.

When a consumer sends an SMS to a brand using the Twilio connector, messages are not being received by UMS due to a momentary failure to open a websocket between the messaging gateway and UMS. This causes the message to be lost.

The current version of the Twilio connector has now been migrated to the new LiveEngage connectors platform, which supports retry mechanism between the messaging gateway and UMS. The new version of the Twilio connector will retry sending the message to UMS, in the case of a message failure.
