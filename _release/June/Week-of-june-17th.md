Offsite engagements were available for web chat only until now, and will now be supported for web messaging as well. Brands can offer web messaging by adding an engagement link from any location and through media including: social media sites, email, digital advertising, and more. Brands can use this link anywhere they want to engage with their consumers. When setting up an offsite engagement, brands create a URL that will refer consumers to web messaging.

For more information on offsite engagements and how they are configured, click [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/messaging-channels-live-chat-displaying-chat-engagements.html#offsite-engagements).

Today, once consumers decide to close a conversation, the conversation is closed but the window remains open. So consumers still need to click on the x button in order to close the window.

This feature provides brands with the ability to set the window behavior so that once the consumers closes the conversation, the window will be either closed automatically or kept open. The default behavior is to keep the window open.

**To enable:**

* Log into [LiveEngage](https://authentication.liveperson.net/)
* Go to Engagement Window Studio
* Click on “Open additional window settings” on the top right
* Click on “Look and feel” section
* Under “Close window upon end of conversation”, choose from one of the following values from the dropdown
  * Keep window open
  * Close window
* Click on “Save”

**Limitations**

* Desktop pop-out engagement window will not be supported

Brands would like the engagement window to have the same look and feel as their website. The font that brands use on their website might not be one of the standard fonts that we provide out-of-the-box in LiveEngage.

This feature allows brands the ability to configure whether to inherit the font style from their webpage for the different engagement window UI elements, without needing to specify the exact font. When brands choose to inherit the font from their website (checkbox is checked), the fonts within the window will be automatically inherited from the webpage the window is launched from that has the most frequently used fonts for the selected window elements. If the webpage font cannot be retrieved, the font that is configured as one of the standard out-of-the-box fonts will be used as a fallback (as shown in the preview). The default behavior would be to use the specified font configured for each element (checkbox is unchecked).

This configuration will be available for the following elements that have font configuration in the engagement window studio:

* Title bar
* Message info
* Automatic messages
* Agent bubble
* Visitor bubble
* Text area
* Menu (under Menu look and feel)

This configuration is available for both chat and web messaging and applies for desktop and mobile. Please note that the pre-chat survey and offline survey font will be inherited, as today, from the automatic messages font settings and post-chat survey font will be inherited from the agent bubble’s font, as it is today.

**To enable:**

* Log into [LiveEngage](https://authentication.liveperson.net/)
* Go to Engagement Window Studio
* Select the relevant element, as listed above
* Click the “Inherit font from webpage” checkboxFallback skill per skill

**Limitations**

* Desktop pop-out engagement window will not be supported

Currently, brands that are looking to use Apple Pay must have a bot added to the conversation via the Agent SDK. To reduce implementation efforts, the ABC Payment response will be added to the Agent Widget SDK. Enhanced security: the new flow will provide a way for brands to sign the payload, which will be verified by the connector before sending out to Apple

* The Apple Pay responses will be exposed to the Agent Widget SDK public model structure
* Brands will be able to expose the Apple Pay response via the Agent widget SDK methods to their backend auth servers in order to validate the token against their services
* Brands will be able to fetch user's payment information from their auth services after validating the token, while exposing the data to the agent on LE via a Customized Agent Widget
* If the payment fails, brands will be able to expose the failed response via the Agent Widget SDK and present the error response to the agent while allowing the agent to help the consumer to perform the payment successfully.
* The Apple Pay message response will be exposed to the agent widget SDK only in case the brands will use the payload signing mechanism to secure the data.

Facebook Handover Protocol enables two or more apps to participate in a conversation by passing control of the conversation between them. This feature makes it possible for a Page to simultaneously use one Facebook app to build a 3rd party bot, outside of LiveEngage, for handling automated responses, and use another Facebook app (LiveEngage) for customer service with human agents.

* By default, all messages are sent to the Primary Receiver app
* When control of the conversation is passed to another, the Facebook Messenger Platform will send messages from the conversation to it instead.
* Only one app may control the conversation at a time.
* All apps that do not have control of the conversation will continue to listen to the conversation by subscribing to the standby webhook event.

Messaging clients will now be able to go through a more automated process for submitting their candidacy to be a WhatsApp early adopter. The new connector will guide them through the application process, and they will be able to check their status through approval and go live.

**How to enable:**

The WhatsApp Business Conversation Source will be enabled automatically for all messaging clients.

During a CoBrowse session, agents can now “maximize” the viewing area so that it uses the entire width of the screen. This covers the engagement area and all the white space within the agent workspace. Agents can find the full screen button by mousing over the same notch at the top which is used for ending the session. The same button is then used to minimize the CoBrowse widget back down to its original size. It will also automatically minimize when navigating to a different conversation. Note also that this works for video calls on web and in-app messaging.

**How to enable:**
This feature is enabled by default.

**Limitations:**
This feature is not available for Internet Explorer 11 users on Windows 7 or 8. The button be completely hidden for agents on that browser and operating system at the same time. Note that Internet Explorer 11 users on Windows 10 will be able to use the feature.

**Join Bots to Conversations:** Recommended Actions widget can now recommend bots that can be joined to conversations. With join, Agents can monitor the conversation between a bot and human in real time, jump in anytime, or remove the bot from the conversation if needed. Maven supports joining bots created in Conversation Builder, Google DialogFlow, and Watson.

**Knowledge Base Integration:** Recommended Actions widget can be connected to Knowledge base articles authored in Conversation Builder. The widget can recommend these articles to agents in real time, and agents can use these articles to provide quick answers to consumers’ questions. For example, what is the refund policy?

Please note: Integration with Conversation Builder (joining bots, or KB suggestions) are not available in Zone 3. This is because CB is currently not available in Zone 3.

## Fix reply indication with audio and tooltip for consumer messages on WhatsApp

### Type: Bug fix

When consumer replies to a message and his reply message is an audio message, the reply icon is missing. Fixed the tooltip alignment for reply icon.

## Post conversation survey

### Type: Bug fix

Post Conversation Survey (PCS) was not triggered for accounts post enablement of the agent group pre filtering feature. The PCS feature should now work for agents from any group if PCS feature is enabled for the account.

## Automatic messages for non-main-group assigned agents

### Type: Bug fix

Automatic messages were not working for non-main-group assigned agents. Controller bot- auto message feature should now work for agents from any group if the auto-message feature is enabled for the account.

## File sharing push notification

### Type: Bug fix

File sharing push notifications prepend the camera emoji to caption text. This behavior should not be implemented in the back-end service. The callers of our API should not expect the text to be mutated as it moves through our system. If a camera emoji is needed in a notification somewhere, it should be up to the app/client to add it.

Additionally, we are prepending the sender name. If the caption is blank, we are substituting "sent you an image". Recently we added support for more file types (doc, ppt, xls, etc.) to file sharing. This message is no longer completely accurate.

Requirements & design work may be necessary here. If there are any implementations dependent on / expecting this behavior (e.g. agent mobile app), we may need to coordinate with that team to alter this behavior. Ultimately, from a UMS perspective, we should not be performing these changes in the back-end.

## Send CustomerInfoEvent and PersonalInfoEvent from SetUserProfile

### Type: Bug fix

In the All Connection page within LiveEngage, all consumers whose conversation was created from SendAPI, displayed as Visitor instead of their original name. The bug has now been resolved.

## Conversations stuck in the queue after transfer/Back2Q

### Type: Bug fix

Intermittently when conversations get transferred or returned to queue, routing service throws an exception on an "undefined" agent name. Following this exception the conversations doesn't get routed to an agent and remains stuck in the destination queue. This bug has now been resolved.

## Photo and file sharing (agent-to-consumer) on mobile devices

### Type: New feature

Mobile Messaging SDK v3.9 introduces a feature for agents within LiveEngage to share photos or files with the consumers.

Agents can share:

* **Photos:** Reference photos or photos of any product to visually guide consumers with product awareness, steps on how to use the product, or review comments of a product. The agent can also share photos in a resolved conversation to resume the conversation with the consumer.  Consumers can tap on the photo to view it full screen or share it through the default app on their device.
* **Files:** Agents can also share files to provide consumers with information such as mortgage documents, product catalog, or transaction details as requested by consumers. They can also share files in a resolved conversation to resume the conversation with the consumer. Consumers can download files through the picker application to a location on their device (internal or external).

**Note:** The Android SDK supports opening any file types other than images through the picker application. The consumer can either long click on the thumbnail or open the file through picker application to share and save the file.  The iOS SDK supports previewing all the supported file types on the device as per the iOS operating system by double-clicking on the thumbnail image.

When the agent shares any supported file type from the LE, if the consumer isn't within the conversation view, they get a notification from the customer app only if the push notification is enabled. Otherwise, when the consumer returns to the conversation screen, a thumbnail for the photo or file appears in the conversation window.
