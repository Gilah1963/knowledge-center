A new dashboard is now introduced, dedicated for reviewing and analyzing survey results in messaging conversations.

This dashboard will include the results to all types of surveys available for messaging channels - including the Post Conversation Survey (PCS), which was previously part of the predefined Messaging Performance dashboard, and any new type of survey that will be available in the future in LiveEngage (including Agent Survey, due later this year).

The new dashboard contains a tab named ‘Survey Data Export’ including 5 panels:

* Predefined survey KPIs
* Answers Distribution - Brand
* Answers Distribution - Agent & Skill
* Survey level analysis
* Question level analysis

The removal of the survey data from the Messaging Performance dashboard will allow to improve the loading time and optimize performance of this dashboard.

**Please note:**

The predefined metrics (CSAT, FCR, NPS and also MCS) will continue to be available in the predefined Performance dashboard for Messaging.

This change will not impact user copies of the Performance dashboard for Messaging created before the removal of the survey data. User copies will continue to work and hold the survey metrics after change the predefined dashboard. Users who made changes to the predefined will be able to continue to use their copy and in parallel use the predefined dashboards for new metrics (such as segments, coming out next month).

More info on reporting on PCS can be found [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/data-reporting-messaging-messaging-dashboards-survey-dashboard-for-messaging.html).

**How to enable**

Enabled OOTB.

This feature enables agents to identify whether a message from a consumer is a reply from a previous message. Consumer can send a message replying to a previous message with a text, an image, an audio message or any of the supported documents. If a message from a consumer is a reply to a previous message, the reply message will have a UI reply indication icon showing in the agent workspace. Please note that the agent will only see the reply indicator icon. There is no reference to the actual message that the consumer refers to.

* PDF
* DOC(X)
* PPT(X)

## \[ABC\] Media files send as text URL when unable to download instead of displaying an error

### Type: Enhancment

When agent sends consumer media file types such as AR, PNG, JPG/JPEG, etc., the Apple Business Chat Connector will try to download the file and send it to the consumer as an attachment. If there are any issues while sending that as an attachment (i.e. file reaches size limit or network issues), the connector will send the consumer the actual URL as text. This will enable the agent to continue sending the URL to the consumer, allowing the consumer to download the media directly from the URL source.
