1. Create your own Twilio account [here](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).

<b>Note:</b>
<ul>
<li>Brands are able to connect multiple Twilio SMS numbers to their account and route each number to a separate skill. If you have more than one SMS number attached to your account and you would like to route them to separate skills, please contact your LivePerson administrator.</li>
<li>Twilio only supports sharing images (MMS) in the US and Canada. Therefore sharing images outside these regions will not work due to Twilio limitations.</li>
