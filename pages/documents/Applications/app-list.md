### Proactive Messaging

Enables brands to proactively initiate two-way conversations with consumers on different messaging platforms such as SMS, WhatsApp, Google RCS or even on the brand’s mobile app, extending LiveEngage to manage all consumer conversations both inbound and outbound.

### Functions

LivePerson’s “Functions” lets brands develop custom behaviors within the LivePerson platform to tailor the conversational platform to specific needs. Using Functions, brands can easily extend LivePerson’s platform by triggering custom code as a reaction to events, such as creating alerts or passing data as a reaction to the change in the status of a conversation.
