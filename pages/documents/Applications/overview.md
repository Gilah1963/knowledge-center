## What are LivePerson Applications?

A LivePerson application allows easy configuration, management, and integration of enhanced capabilities and features with a LivePerson account. Applications are either developed by LivePerson ("Global applications") or by a non-LivePerson developer ("Private applications").

These applications provide many benefits by allowing account administrators to seamlessly navigate between many different applications so that the experience is of a connected ecosystem of business enhancements. The result is that users can work simultaneously in LiveEngage and many other applications (for example, an agent manager can both supervise on-going conversations and use the Report Builder at the same time).

### Managing applications

As we focus on delivering self serve management capabilities to our customers, a new dedicated dashboard where you can manage LivePerson applications by yourself has been added to LiveEngage. This new dashboard allows administrators to manage all LivePerson applications on their account. When LivePerson adds a new application, it will appear on your dashboard for configuration, installation and management. In addition, this dashboard also allows the installation of new private applications by providing an easy to use UI for uploading and configuring them.

For more information on how to use the new Applications dashboard, [please refer to the user guide](liveperson-applications-user-guide.html).

## Why should I use LivePerson Applications?

LivePerson Applications enhance the capabilities of account administrators and allows them to easily manage applications which will enrich LivePerson eco-system with further capabilities. Since these capabilities are installed in a standard and pre-determined way, they are usable alongside other LivePerson services. This allows LivePerson to provide complete and out of the box, ready to use products. This allows admins to manage their applications, without the need to reach out to LivePerson support teams.

Further, the ability to develop and install private applications yourself, means that extending the LivePerson platform becomes self service and easy to do while still supporting industry standards for security and stability. If you're looking to add more powerful capabilities and services to the LivePerson platform, private applications are the way to go!

## Global vs. private Applications

A **global application** is an application which is published in the Applications Marketplace by a developer and will be available for all LivePerson customers to install and manage within the Applications dashboard. These applications are installed by LivePerson. [A list of global applications can be found here](liveperson-applications-global-applications-list.html).

A **private application** is an application which a certain customer can develop, test and use on their accounts. These applications wonâ€™t be published in the Marketplace and thus will be available only for the brand which developed them. Private applications can be developed and uploaded for use without needing to contact LivePerson directly, simply by following a pre-determined schema.

Your account comes pre-configured with a certain amount of global applications which LivePerson have decided to pre-install on all accounts. However, there are other types of global applications that have not been pre-installed on your account but which are available to install by contacting your LivePerson account team.

## Building a private Application

In order to build and install a private application, you will need to create and upload a JSON schema. More information on this schema and other considerations when building a private application can be found in the Developers' Community.

## Installing a private application

The Applications Dashboard allows you to install private application which you have built. Please see our user guide for more information on how to install private applications.
