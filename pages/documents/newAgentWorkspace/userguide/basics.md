As an agent, your workspace is a centralized location for handling all of your conversations. Below are the main areas and tools you'll be using within the workspace for your daily messaging operations. 

## Dynamic conversation list

The new dynamic conversation list is sorted by SLA, or response time. Conversations with the shortest SLA are the most urgent, and are therefore sorted to the top of the list. The list updates automatically after every agent action or incoming conversation, ensuring that the most important conversations are always prioritized. This allows you to efficiently work through the conversation list by always focusing your attention on the conversation at the top of the list, rather than manually determining who to help next. 

The conversation list is comprehensive, including ongoing, overdue, idle, and closed conversations that are filterable by status. Clicking on each conversation will allow you to read the transcript, browse different widgets and start engaging with your customers. If you choose to click on a consumer’s name, it will open up the entire conversation and you can begin messaging.

### My Connections
The My Connections list includes all of the recent conversations that were assigned to you, including conversations that were recently closed. You can work through your My Connections list from the top down, and filter closed conversations into the list at the end of your shift to ensure you documented everything properly. 

### All Connections 
While the My Connections list only stores conversations that were recently handled (the length of time depends on your contact center's configuration), the All Connections list includes all of the conversations you have handled historically. It can be filtered and used to find previous conversations that require a follow up.

## Conversation status and filters

The new conversation list includes ongoing, overdue, idle, and closed conversations. By default, ongoing, overdue and idle conversations are filtered on. Conversations with the idle or closed status can be filtered in or out of the list. Ongoing and overdue conversations **cannot** be filtered out of the conversation list. 

You can filter conversations in the list by status:

| Status        | Icon    |  Description        | Use    |
| ------------- |-------------| ------------- |-------------| 
| Ongoing | ![alt text](img/ongoing-conversation-status.png) |Ongoing conversations are open conversations that are currently active.|These conversations are in the list by default and **cannot** be filtered out.|
| Overdue |![alt text](img/overdue-conversation-status.png) |Conversations that were not answered before the SLA has expired. |These conversations are in the list by default and **cannot** be filtered out.|
| Idle |![alt text](img/idle-conversation-status.png) |Conversations in which the consumer hasn’t replied for 5 minutes or longer, defined as inactive.|These conversations are filterable. Filter them **out of the list** for a more succinct list of conversations that require urgent action.|
| Closed |![alt text](img/closed-conversation-status.png) |Conversations that have been marked as ‘closed’ by you, by consumers, or have been automatically closed by the system due to timeout. |These conversations are filterable. Filter them **into the list** at the end of your shift, or if you have down time to review your documentation.|

## Your personal data bar

As you go about your shift, your own agent data bar will display on the top of your workspace and will update immediately. This will help you keep track of your performance as well as expected workload. The data bar in the agent workspace represents the real-time tracking of your current workload and shift.

The data bar in your workspace will represent the queue data that is relevant only to you and your conversations for the current shift. Here you will see real-time data tracking the following:

**OPEN:** number of current open conversations

**PENDING:** number of conversations pending an agent response

**OVERDUE:** number of conversations that exceeded the target response time

**SOON TO BE OVERDUE:** number of conversations about to exceed the target response time in 5 minutes

**ACTIONABLE:** number of conversations that are waiting to be assigned to an agent in the queue and have an immediate action (e.g. reply to a waiting customer)

**IN QUEUE:** overall number of conversations in the queue, including actionable and not actionable. A not actionable conversation is one that is still open but awaiting a consumer reply. Only the actionable conversations are routed to agents.

**CSAT:** displays the customer satisfaction score based on the Post Conversation Surveys that were completed in the last 12 hours.

## Shortcuts & hotkeys

To save you time - there are eight hotkeys configured on your workspace for some of the most common tasks. 

Open the hotkeys menu by holding down the control and tilde keys (CTRL + ~).
On UK keyboards, hold down the control and apostrophe keys (CTRL + '). 

Select an action by pressing the applicable letter from the table below.


| ACTION        | HOTKEY    | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| LOGOUT of the agent workspace  | L |
