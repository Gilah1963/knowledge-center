## Beginning your shift

When you start your shift, you should change your status to online in order to start receiving messages. To change your status, click on your image in the bottom left corner to open the drop down status menu and select **Online**. Once you do that, conversations from the queue will be assigned to you based on their priority. If there are already existing conversations in your queue, you will see them here, in the My Connections list.

### Warm up: staggered incoming conversations at the beginning of your shift

Some contact centers opt to configure the ‘warm up’ function for agents. If this is enabled, the incoming conversations assigned to you at the beginning of your shift will be slower and build gradually. The warm up feature will send you one message at a time with a defined interval between the first few incoming conversations, allowing you to adjust to your shift and get into the flow of your messaging workload.

## Taking incoming conversations

The updated agent workspace uses SLA to prioritize conversations on your behalf, allowing you to simply respond to the conversation at the top of the list. By default, the list will have ongoing, overdue, and idle conversations filtered on. You can filter idle and closed conversations out to keep your list concise and stay focused on the most urgent conversations.

Once you start handling conversations, you should work through the conversation list from top to bottom. Once you handle a customer, more customers can come in, and when you finish the conversation you will be taken to the next conversation in the list.

Conversations that reach your workplace have already undergone detailed analysis and prioritization. Based on the configurations selected by you contact center manager, there are two ways to accept incoming conversations into your workspace:

* **Auto accept**: This means conversations will automatically enter your list and be sorted without any action on your end, and your conversation list will automatically update when a new conversation is added. This is a more popular configuration for call centers.

* **Advanced mode**: For this option, incoming messages will ‘ring’ in your workspace and you’ll have to manually click to open and move this conversation to your conversation list, sorted by SLA. If you do not click to accept an incoming conversation and other agents are available, it will circle and ring to other available agents.

## Understanding the context & history

There are several tools in place to help you access the information you’ll need to provide excellent service and understand your consumers and their intent.

* **Conversation summary**: This dedicated widget enables you to write notes and comments after finishing a conversation. It has been enhanced to support the entering of multiple notes by several agents, allowing you to see a log of comments for context. Since the connection may be ongoing, these notes will help you quickly catch up on the conversation and keep other agents in the loop should it be assigned to them in the future.

* **Conversation history**: For repeat customers, any previous messaging history will be displayed directly in the conversation transcript. This way you can simply scroll up to review previous conversations, rather than needing to switch screens and navigate to a dedicated widget. The conversation history will be stored within the conversation for up to 13 months, to view history beyond this please check your CRM.

* **Consumer info**: This widget automatically displays important information about the consumer who is messaging you. This information will include the source channel of the conversation or any custom variables collected by your contact center.

## Replying to consumers

### Predefined Content

You can reply by using free text, but we recommend using predefined content. Your contact center manager would have created a set of quick answers to the most common inquiries that you can easily enter into the conversation. By choosing predefined content templates, you can lower your average response time by saving time that would have been spent typing out responses. Some predefined answers will have associated hotkeys that will enable you to enter responses even more easily.

### Rich messaging 

There are many tools at your disposal that can be used to foster relationships and carry out effective conversations. Rich messaging enhances the consumer experience by providing a richer, more engaging channel of communication.

The following types of rich messaging are being supported for the enhanced agent workspace: 
* Structured content cards and carousels 
* Consumer to agent photo sharing (coming September)
* Consumer to agent audio sharing (coming September)
* Agent to consumer file sharing (coming September)

## Additional actions 

While conducting a conversation, there are a few actions you can take:

**Copy as plain text:** This action opens a window that includes that text of the conversation that can be copied to anywhere you need, such as into a CRM record.

**Transfer conversation (coming September):** Select a skill to transfer your conversation to. Use the search bar to find the relevant skill. Once you do this, the conversation will move out of your workspace and enter that skill’s queue.

**Resume conversation (coming September):** This action reopens a closed conversation in order for you to follow up with a customer. 

### Adjusting the SLA for follow up

Every time a consumer sends a message, the SLA, or your expected time to reply resets. For example, if you are expected to respond within 1 minute, each time a consumer answers a message the one minute will start over and the conversation will be prioritized automatically and adjusted appropriately in your conversation.

As an agent, you are able to control the amount of time you need to reply to consumers manually. For example, if you are chatting with a customer and you need to check the status on their application, you can let the customer know that you’ll get back to them in a couple of hours and then manually adjust the SLA of this conversation. By doing so, it will appear in your queue in the appropriate time and remind you to follow up with the customer.

## Closing conversations

The nature of messaging conversations is that they are ongoing and can be resumed at anytime. However, in order to manage agent work streams and ensure consumer requests have been fulfilled, conversations can be marked as ‘closed.’ A closed conversation can be reopened again - either by the consumer or by the agent - with the entire history kept intact.

The conversations can be marked as resolved or closed, either by the consumer or the agent. Within the conversation window, customers have ‘options’, one of which is to select to closed a conversation. For messaging channels such as SMS or Facebook Messenger, where a custom ‘options’ table is not available, customers will not be able to mark conversations as closed. As an agent, you can close a conversation when you know that it has been resolved. Closing a conversation is done via the drop down menu within the conversation window. It is important that you close conversations as soon as you are confident that they are resolved in order to clear your work queue and keep your performance KPIs accurate.

At the end of your shift or during downtime you can use the status filter to filter closed conversations back into your My Connections. This will allow you to review your conversation summaries and ensure that your conversations were properly documented. Closed conversations are stored in the My Connections list for between 48 hours up to 14 days, depending on your contact center's configuration. Conversations that exceed this can be found in the All Connections list.

### Surveys

**Post Conversation Survey:** Upon the closing of a conversation (whether done by the customer, by you or automatically) the Post Conversation Survey will be triggered to the customer (as defined by your brand). This survey is comprised of CSAT, NPS or other custom questions. The CSAT scores calculated for your performance in the KPI bar are derived from results calculated from the Post Conversation Survey.

**Agent survey (date TBD):** The agent survey, which was previously available only for chat, allows brands to gather data and insights from their agents about their conversations with consumers. Gathering data from your perspective helps them to determine and analyze the nature of conversations and understand their outcomes. Once collected, this information can be used to recognize issues and optimize messaging operations.  

### Auto Close for inactive conversations

For conversations that are awaiting a consumer response, the auto close mechanism will automatically close these conversations after a length of time that has been defined by your contact center manager. Conversations will not be subject to auto close if they are pending an agent’s reply or if you have set up a manual SLA. Learn more about auto close for messaging here.
