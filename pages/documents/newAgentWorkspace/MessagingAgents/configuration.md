The agent workspace is tailored to the needs of messaging agents and was designed using feedback and requests from hundreds of messaging agents. It is developed for an easy plug-and-play approach and requires little to no configuration.  

There are a few configurations that brands can elect to control for the agent experience as outlined below.  

## Enabling the enhanced workspace 

Messaging agents can access the enhanced agent workspace starting on September 16th, but it is off by default and must be enabled in permissions. 

To do so, managers must go to the profiles tab in the users module. Select the name of the relevant profile, then under permissions toggle on 'Use enhanced agent workspace" and save the changes. This will give all users that have been assigned this profile access to the enhanced workspace.

## Configuration from your LivePerson workspace

**Please note:** If you have set up the below configurations for the existing agent workspace, you do not need to set them again - they will automatically apply.

### Auto accept

Set up:
1. Login to LivePerson as an admin and access the Night Vision settings by clicking on the Night Vision icon to the top right of the screen.
2. Select ‘auto accept’ or ‘advanced’ mode.

## Additional custom configuration options

Contact your LivePerson representative to customize the following parameters per your requirements.

**Min:** 1 day

**Max:** 14 days
