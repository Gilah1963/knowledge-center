## Post Conversation Survey bot

The November newsletter video features the [Post Conversation Survey](ai-bots-automation-post-conversation-survey-bot.html) - a feature that helps brands take advantage of increased traffic and get feedback from their customers in a conversational format:

This month the following features were also released:

## Connector support of structured content "External ID" metadata

Using the structured content framework, messaging connector channels that are enabled with Rich Content (i.e, FBM, ABC and Google RCS Business Messaging) are able to share cards, carousels, lists and quick replies via LivePerson. This connector allows you to track and report on the number of times a specific card was sent, delivered or viewed, as well as track the number of times a specific button was selected.

## Skill Segment Metrics in Real-time Dashboard (RTD)

You can now take advantage of new skill-based metrics within the [real-time dashboard](data-reporting-messaging-real-time-data-real-time-data-for-messaging.html) to better manage and optimize messaging performance - made available from our Open Platform APIs. This includes the addition of several new metrics into the Current, Closed and Skill sections of the Real-time Dashboard.

## Demo App - Connector API

The Demo App provides an interface that demonstrates the consumer experience using the [Connector API](https://developers.liveperson.com/connector-api-sample-code-connector-sample-app.html) so developers can test their connector prior to having a live consumer interface.

The demo app runs as a standalone application. LivePerson open sources the code and deploys a version on Amazon so that interested customers get an impression how a connecter will appear similar to a [demo app](https://developers.liveperson.com/connector-api-sample-code-connector-sample-app.html "https://developers.liveperson.com/connector-api-sample-code-connector-sample-app.html").
